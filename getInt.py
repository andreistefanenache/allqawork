Task 4 â€“ Input an Integer Between Two Limits
In this part you'll ask the user to input an integer between a minimum and maximum values.
	If the user fails to enter an acceptable value for three times then you stop asking!
1.	Add a new file: getInt.py and make it the startup file.
2.	Create two variables for the min and max values. 
Set two values for these variables such as 1 and 100.
3.	Write a while loop that attempts to get an integer from the user between the limits of min and max values.
4.	If the user has tried three times and fails then print None. 
If a valid value is entered, just end the loop and print its value.

Note: None is a valid keyword in Python which stands for Null.
