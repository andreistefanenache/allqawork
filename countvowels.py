Task 3 - Count Vowels    
1.	Add a new file: CountVowels.py and make it the startup file.  
2.	Inputs a word (a string).
3.	Counts how many vowels are in the word.   
Tip: You can scroll through every character of a string using its index.
For example, if word =  'hello' then word[0] is the letter h and word[1] is the letter e.
Use the len() function to find the length of a string. For example, in the above example,  	 len(word) is 5.
Use simple if statement/s to detect if the character is 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o'  or  'u'.
Every time you find a vowel you must increase a counter (an integer variable).
In the next chapter (Lists) you'll discover a much easier way of performing this task.
4.	Save and run.
